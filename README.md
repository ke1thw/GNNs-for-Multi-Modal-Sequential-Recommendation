# GNNs-for-Multi-Modal-Sequential-Recommendation
### Data Science & Computer Science Capstone Project:
This work introduces an innovative approach that utilizes graph neural networks to capture item-item relations between different modal- ities based on itemsâ€™ multi-modal modalities for sequential recommendation tasks. Our work shows a promising result on the dataset with low sparsity.
